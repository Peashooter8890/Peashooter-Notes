# Peashooter-Notes
This is Peashooter's notes on anything related to technology, programming, mathematics, and similar. 
I try to study various different areas related to mathematics and computer science. While the notes are mostly for myself, I try to write them in a way so that other people could look at them and learn from them if they desire. 
My notes will grow over time and become a large base with intuitive explanations on many different topics!

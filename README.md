# Peashooter-Notes
This is Peashooter's notes on anything related to technology, programming, mathematics, and similar. 
I try to study various different areas related to mathematics and computer science. While the notes are mostly for myself, I try to write them in a way so that other people could look at them and learn from them if they desire. 
My notes will grow over time and become a large base with intuitive explanations on many different topics!

However, if you notice any inconsitencies in my notes, that's mostly because I still learned the corresponding material but simply decided not to take notes. Throughout my self-studying journey, I've discovered that focusing on note-taking too much will lead to wasted time. My focus right now is primarily on my own learning and not on providing content to the public (I might focus on that later on in the future, but not now). Therefore, this github exists mainly for me to practice the feynman technique and for potential curious people to get an overview of what kind of progress I am making.
